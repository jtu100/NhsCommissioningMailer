NhsCommissioningMailer
======================

The idea behind this simple app is to take a very large spreadsheet which contains patient-level commissioning data for all the surgeries in a CCG, and split it up on a surgery-by-surgery basis into smaller spreadsheets which can be automatically emailed to multiple recipients at the associated surgeries, securely via NHS.net.

Development started as part of nhshackday.com in Oxford 2013.
